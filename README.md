## Professional Profile/Portfolio for Matt Tierney 


My motivation for this project was to put what i have learned thus far in HTML, and CSS to create website. The purpose of this website is to help potential employers get in touch with me and showcase my work, and projects while in the KU coding bootcamp. 

I learned how to use anchor links to help users navigate my paige. Spacing, padding, and sizing my containers to fit the resolution. I still would like to and plan on working on this long after the turn in date to perfect my knowledge and use of containers.

I think my project stands out for its apperance, use of background images in nav bar and footer. As well as matching borders. 
Some impressive features of this project are browser/window resizing, anchor links, and an email link to make it more convienient for users to reach me.
